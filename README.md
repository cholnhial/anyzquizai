# AnyQuizAI

AnyQuizAI is a full-stack project I developed to practice and showcase my full stack developer skills. This project incorporates novel technologies such as Spring AI and demonstrates the development of LLM-driven applications.

## Project Purpose

**Important:** I created AnyQuizAI as a personal project to hone my full stack development skills and gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. It serves as a practical example of building a complete web application that integrates various components of modern web such as Angular and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
