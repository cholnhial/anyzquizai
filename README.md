# AnyQuizAI
AnyQuizAI lets users generate a quiz of any topic which they can make available for others or set it to be removed after a certain number of days. A quiz is automatically given a unique six code identifier which can be used to join it. Users can choose to generate a quiz or explore the library to find one by various topics, difficulty and length of questions. 

## Why 

This project demonstrates a breadth of my FullStack skills across different techniques. I wanted to use it as an opportunity to try out new technologies such as Spring AI and new language enhancements introduced to Java.
